## A draft map of the mouse pluripotent stem cell spatial proteome

**Abstract** Knowledge of the subcellular distribution of proteins is
vital for understanding cellular mechanisms. Capturing the subcellular
proteome in a single experiment has proven challenging, with studies
focusing on specific compartments or assigning proteins to subcellular
niches with low resolution and/or accuracy. Here we introduce
hyperLOPIT, a method that couples extensive fractionation,
quantitative high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry with
multivariate data analysis. We apply hyperLOPIT to a pluripotent stem
cell population whose subcellular proteome has not been extensively
studied. We provide localization data on over 5,000 proteins with
unprecedented spatial resolution to reveal the organization of
organelles, sub-organellar compartments, protein complexes, functional
networks and steady-state dynamics of proteins and unexpected
subcellular locations. The method paves the way for characterizing the
impact of post-transcriptional and post-translational modification on
protein location and studies involving proteome-level locational
changes on cellular perturbation. An interactive open-source resource
is presented that enables exploration of these data.
